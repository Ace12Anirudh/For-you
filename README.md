# For-you
# # It is for you. If you have to see , run it through.

I tried to write something --


A blush of pink, a velvet touch,

These petals soft, I love so much.

A silent offering, a whispered plea,

My heart's true language, given free.

If doubt remains, or words won't do,

If you have to see, run it through,

This fragrant message, light and bright,

And understand my love's pure light.
